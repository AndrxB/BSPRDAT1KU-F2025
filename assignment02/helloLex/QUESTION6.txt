Consider the 3 examples of input provided at the prompt and
the result.
Explain why the results are expected behaviour from the lexer.

Example 1: 34
hello3 recognizes floats and integers.
This means that 34 should pass, since it is an integer.
34 passes, because the regex is partly [0-9]+.
This part means that the regex allows 1 or more digits from
0 to 9.

Example 2: 34.24
hello3 uses '.' instead of ',' as a
decimal separator. This allows for the entirety of 34.24
to be recognized.
The part "([0-9]*[.])?[0-9]+" of hello3 defines that
there at least has to be one digit present, but as soon as
a '.' is placed in front, those digits become decimals.
As shown in the regex above, whole numbers are completely
optional whenever a '.' is placed.
You could write '.24' and it would still be recognized. 

Example 3: 34,34

The decimals and the decimal separator are both excluded
from the recognition, because ',' is not legal according
to the regex defined for hello3.
34 is still recognized for the same reason as example 1.
